The code for this project is not showed here, though a comprehensive explanation of the motivations and technologies used on its development, paired with videos demonstraiting the App's functionalities should give a complete picture of what Kentica is about, and why it granted my team and I the 1st place on the 2023 iOS Community Changemakers national hackathon.

## Motivations

Kentica is a SwiftUI App focused on the Health and wellbeing sustainable objective proposed by the World Health Organization. Its objective is to put a breive halt on negative emotion explotions that someone might find throughout their day. Kentica had its beginnings in experiences and technics that our friends had in regards of their own struggles with strong emotions. 

With that said, Kentica makes use of ARKit to present the user with different AR activities meant to give pause to a person.

## Functionalities

- Color Search

The first activity presented is "Busca Colores" wich is a game that, ussing AR places a bunch of color spheres around the player position for them to locate all the balls of one specific color in specific. The game lets the user calm down through the distraction of searching around for every ball that the game asks.

- Hologram

The second button, is aimed towards telepresence, inside the "Acompa√±ante" mode we can see a human projection, displaying how to breath calmly for the user to imitate them. While in the video we can se my teammate Diego, the idea that my team and I would like for the future of Kentica is for everyone to be able to upload a small video of a relative, friend or loved one for it to be displayed in place of the video that is showned in the video.
