# SwiftUI_Development

Includes both excersices made for getting familiarized with the SwiftUI framework and completed projects that I completed in university. 
It is worth to mention that both projects, "RCPAR" and "Kentica" are located here as well,
this being the 1st place winning apps made for the local and national stages of the 2023 iOS Community Changemakers hackathon respectively.
Both apps are paired with their Keynote file and additional assets (like logos or other videos) used for presenting each product to the corresponding jury at the local and national hackathon.
